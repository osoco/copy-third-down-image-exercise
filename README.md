# Copy third down exercise

This is a very simple exercise to check computational thinking skills.

## Description

We have to program a function named `copyTopThird()` receiving a parameter `picture` representing an image.

The function takes in a picture and copies the top third of the image onto the bottom third of the image.

## Test case

Given the following input image:

The image should be changed to the following one:

## Solution hints

You can use any existing programming language you know or an invented syntax (something like pseudocode).

You can suppose the existence of any number of auxiliary functions you need. Simply enumerate them in your solution file with a
brief description about their behaviour.

Write your solution in a `solution.md` file in this repository. In the case you think alternative solutions write them
as `solution-1.md`, `solution-2.md`, and so on.
